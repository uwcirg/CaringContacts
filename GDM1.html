									<p>The suicide rate has increased 28% over the past two decades while heart disease, diabetes, and cancer mortalities have declined. Since 2011, new standards have led to improved suicide risk screening and risk management. Treatment, however, has lagged because delivering most well-established psychotherapies at scale is infeasible. Thus, the need for suicide prevention has skyrocketed without available resources to meet demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound psychological and social effects and has exacerbated the demand for telehealth and technology-mediated communications. The necessity for an accelerated shift to highly scalable and technology-based solutions for suicide prevention will not be reversed. The suicide rate has increased 28% over the past two decades while heart disease, diabetes, and cancer mortalities have declined.

Treatment, however, has lagged because it's impractical to provide most widely recognized forms of psychotherapy on a large scale. Thus, the need for suicide prevention has skyrocketed without available resources to meet demand.

									<p>Caring Contacts (CC) is one of only two interventions that have been found to prevent death by suicide in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The original Caring Contacts intervention was developed by Motto in the late 1970s and guided by the following principles (Motto JA, 1976) (adapted from pg. 223-224): </p>

											<p>The forces that bind us willingly to life are mostly those exerted by our reciprocal relationships with our environment and the beings in it, whether they be intimately involved in our lives or influence us by other psychological processes.</p>

											<p>A suicidal person can be encouraged to retain an interest in continued living, by regular and long-term contact with another person who expresses caring about the former’s wellbeing.</p>
										</section>
										<section class="feature">
											
											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>The contact must be initiated by the concerned person and must put no demands or expectations on the other, in order to be experienced as an expression of unconditional concern and to have a potential for reducing feelings of isolation and helplessness.</p>
										</section>

											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>Such a program of continuing contact can exert a long-term prevention influence on high-risk persons who cannot accept the established health care system or who have unmet needs. Long-term follow-up from an RCT comparing Caring Contacts to treatment as usual (TAU) found participants in the Caring Contacts condition had a lower suicide rate in all five years of the study and a significantly lower rate for the first two years (Motto & Bostrom, 2001).</p>

									<h2>Recipient Experience</h2>
									<p>Feeling suicidal is so much about feeling alone and feeling this will never change. Caring Contacts arrive periodically - weekly, monthly - over a year or more showing continued care, interest, and support with no effort from the recipient.</p>
									<p>Caring Contacts can be offered as aftercare following hospitalization or a safety plan and has been used successfully with recipients from a variety of backgrounds - military, veteran, youth, native communities, primary care and emergency departments, healthcare providers, etc. - from around the globe including the US, Australia, and Iran.</p>

									<h2>More About The Research</h2>
									<p>The caring letters intervention was replicated in a shortened 12-month protocol by Carter who sent postcards (in envelopes) to individuals who had been admitted to a toxicology unit for self-poisoning. Although there were no differences in proportion of each study condition who were hospitalized for self-poisoning, there was more repetition of deliberate self-poisoning in the control group than among those receiving postcards. These differences persisted for at least 5 years (Carter, Clover, Whyte, Dawson, & D’Este, 2005, 2007, 2013). Hassanian-Moghaddam and colleagues replicated the Carter and colleagues’ postcard intervention in Iran with a sample of 2300 self-poisoners; with minor modifications including using floral greeting cards, including poetry stanzas, and sending a message on their birthday. Results found fewer individuals in the caring letters condition reported suicidal ideation and fewer made a suicide attempt (Hassanian-Moghaddam, Sarjami, Kolahi, & Carter, 2011; Hassanian-Moghaddam, Sarjami, Kolahi, Lewin, & Carter, 2015). </p>
									
									<p>Comtois and colleagues (Comtois, Kerbrat, & DeCou, 2017) recently completed a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) of Caring Contacts using text messaging in the military. The format was the same as the postcard studies except using 11 brief text messages instead of a postcard or greeting card over one year. A typical text message read “Hi John, Hope everything’s going well. – Kate mcproj.org” or “Hello again, John! Hope things are good. Kate mcproj.org” (where mcproj.org is a website that provided military specific resources and the names and job titles of study staff). Results showed significantly fewer Marines and Soldiers in the Caring Contacts condition reported (1) any suicidal ideation and (2) any suicide attempts during the intervention year. </p>
