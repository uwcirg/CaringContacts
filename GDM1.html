									<!--<p>The suicide rate has increased 28% over the past two decades while heart disease, diabetes, and cancer mortalities have declined. Since 2011, new standards have led to improved screening and management of suicide risk. Treatment, however, has lagged because it's impractical to provide most widely recognized forms of psychotherapy on a large scale. Thus, the need for suicide prevention has skyrocketed without available resources to meet demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound psychological and social effects and has exacerbated the demand for telehealth and technology-mediated communications. </p>-->

									<p>Caring Contacts (CC) is one of only two interventions that have been found to prevent death by suicide in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The original Caring Contacts intervention was developed by Jerome Motto in the late 1970s and guided by the following principles: </p>
							
									<div class="items style3 big">
										<section class="feature">
											
											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>The forces that bind us willingly to life are mostly those exerted by our reciprocal relationships with our environment and the beings in it, whether they be intimately involved in our lives or influence us by other psychological processes.</p>
										</section>
										<section class="feature">
											
											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>A suicidal person can be encouraged to retain an interest in continued living, by regular and long-term contact with another person who expresses caring about the former’s wellbeing.</p>
										</section>
										<section class="feature">
											
											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>The contact must be initiated by the concerned person and must put no demands or expectations on the other, in order to be experienced as an expression of unconditional concern and to have a potential for reducing feelings of isolation and helplessness.</p>
										</section>
										<section class="feature">
											
											<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
											
											<p>Such a program of continuing contact can exert a long-term prevention influence on high-risk persons who cannot accept the established health care system or who have unmet needs. Long-term follow-up from an RCT comparing Caring Contacts to treatment as usual (TAU) found participants in the Caring Contacts condition had a lower suicide rate in all five years of the study and a significantly lower rate for the first two years.</p>

									<h2>Recipient Experience</h2>
									<img src="images/Frame 65.png" class="image fit">

									<p>Feeling suicidal is so much about feeling alone and feeling this will never change. Caring Contacts arrive periodically—weekly, monthly, bi-monthly—over a year or longer showing continued care, interest, and support with no effort from the recipient. Caring Contacts participants report that messages continuing to come over time have been healing for them.</p>
									<p>Caring Contacts can also be a bridge to help someone ask for help who would not otherwise have asked. It is not uncommon for someone to reply to their 8- or 10-month Caring Contact with a request for help, resources, or a pathway back to treatment that ended months before. </p>
									<p>Caring Contacts can be offered as aftercare following safety planning or hospitalization and has been used successfully with recipients from a variety of backgrounds - military, veteran, youth, native communities, primary care and emergency departments, healthcare providers, etc. - from around the globe including the US, Australia, and Iran. </p>

									<h2>Provider Experience</h2>
									<!--<img src="images/Frame 66.png" class="image fit">-->
									<p>Despite the strong support for the Caring Contacts intervention, very few health systems are using Caring Contacts. In addition, many have made maladaptive adaptations that weaken core Caring Contacts principles. These maladaptive modifications occur largely because the steps to carry out the intervention often fall outside of established workflows. There has not been an easily accessible guidebook for planning, initiating, and delivering the messages, until now.</p>

									<h2>Learn more about the research!</h2>
									<p>The original Caring Contacts study with postal mail in the US was replicated in a shortened 12-month protocol by researchers in Australia who sent postcards (in envelopes) to individuals who had been admitted to a toxicology unit for self-poisoning. Although there were no differences in the proportion of each study condition who were hospitalized for self-poisoning, there was more repetition of deliberate self-poisoning in the control group than among those receiving postcards. These differences persisted for at least 5 years. Other scientists replicated the postcard intervention in Iran with a sample of 2300 self-poisoners; with minor modifications including using floral greeting cards, including poetry stanzas, and sending a message on their birthday. Results found fewer individuals in the caring letters condition reported suicidal ideation and fewer made a suicide attempt.</p>
									<p>Starting in 2016, Caring Contacts moved from postal mail to text message in a study with the US Army and Marine Corps. The format was the same as the postcard studies except using 11 brief text messages instead of a postcard or greeting card over one year. A typical text message read “Hi John, Hope everything’s going well. – Kate mcproj.org” or “Hello again, John! Hope things are good. Kate mcproj.org” (where mcproj.org is a website that provided military specific resources and the names and job titles of study staff). Results showed significantly fewer Marines and Soldiers in the Caring Contacts condition reported (1) any suicidal ideation and (2) any suicide attempts during the intervention year.  Text message were also used in a comparative study of two different models of Caring Contacts sent to both patients and healthcare providers in a rural and frontier health system in Idaho, USA during the COVID pandemic. Although outcomes were comparable between models, satisfaction with Caring Contacts was very high for both patients and providers. </p>
									<p>Since that study, further research into implementing Caring Contacts with veteran populations has been conducted, and the findings on veterans’ preferences regarding the intervention can be found in these papers: </p>
