							<h2>&nbsp</h2><h2><b>Practical Guide to Sending Caring Contacts </b></h2>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Now that you have reviewed the background content and benefits of Caring Contacts, let’s get started implementing Caring Contacts in your organization!</p>
							<p>This guide offers advice and recommendations for all phases of design, planning, and implementation, along with guidance on how to manage day-to-day implementation challenges. We’ve also provided decision support tools, pre-scheduled message templates, and quick-reference guides for your team to use, as well as links to further information and interactive trainings. An additional practical toolkit including pre-built Mosio texting platforms, standard operating procedures, and quality controls is coming soon. </p>
							<p>Here are some terms you should know:</p>

							<h2 id="1">Chapter 1. Structure Caring Contacts Intervention: Designing to fit your organization</h2>
							<h3 id="1Population">Identify Population</h3>
							<p>Your organization will need to decide which of your clients/patients should receive the intervention – that is, who are the <b>“recipients”</b> of the Caring Contacts. This will be highly dependent on the population you serve and what their needs and desires are.</p>
							<p>Perhaps,</p>
							<div class="items style3 big">
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2> 
									<p>You want to send them to individuals tied to a particular event (e.g., patients who are discharged from the hospital, clients who completed behavioral health treatment, veterans who stopped attending programming, first responders working during a pandemic, a service member who seeks help with suicidal thoughts) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-star" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them based on a screening instrument or measure of stress or distress (e.g., veterans who are unemployed or unhoused, patients who report depression or suicidality on a screener, staff who report high burnout) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-end" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them to all participants in your program or at the completion of your program (e.g., send to veterans after a women’s retreat for PTSD, patients after an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization program, crisis line callers, Employee Assistance program for burnout) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-medical" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them to people who were uninterested or unable to participate in treatments you recommend (e.g., patients experiencing suicidality but uninterested in psychotherapy or medications, rape survivors who could come to treatment any time but can’t face it right now) </p>
								</section>
							</div>
						
							<h3 id="1Message">Message Format & Medium</h3>
							<p class="major"><b>The Caring Contacts Intervention can be implemented via emails, texts, physical mail, and phone calls. Digital options such as email and text are familiar to the recipient and are easy to track.  While each medium has its benefits, the best evidence is for physical mail and text messages. You’ll need to choose the format that best suits your organization and especially your patients/clients.</b></p>
							<p>While it can be more cost-efficient and timesaving to send Caring Contacts through email or texts, it has been theorized that physical mail might carry a certain emotional impact that digital communication does not. While phone calls have been previously tested, they require a greater workload for the organization and can lead to conversations that veer away from the Caring Contacts message. Our team has found that the majority of participants prefer to be contacted via written communication.  </p>
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
										<header>
											<h4>How do you want to send the messages?</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p> Physical mail, such as letters and postcards, is supported by research. Recipients appreciate the extra effort made to send physical mail and personalize the messages, especially if handwritten. However, this process is difficult to scale, requires more work, and is less responsive than other methods. A small organization that likes to lend a personal touch to their work may prefer this method, while larger organizations or users that want to utilize efficient technology may not. </p>
											<p>Caring Contacts Trials with email have been challenging logistically and less well-liked by recipients, perhaps because email has become more about business communication, bills, and spam and less about personal communication. </p> 
											<p>Health systems have considered using secure electronic health record (EHR) messaging applications such as MyChart, eCare, or similar options to send Caring Contacts, which may seems simple and appealing, but for the recipient, is neither. The login requirement voids the non-demanding nature of the Caring Contacts intervention, and recipients may be frustrated to learn that the message is neither time-sensitive nor medical in nature. Furthermore, the option to receive messages through an EHR like MyChart was presented to research study participants to assess potential interest. Out of the sample of 16 interviewees, all but one stated that they would not be interested in receiving messages through their EHR because of the very reasons stated above: compared to simply reading a text or email on their phone, they thought that logging into the secure system would take far too long and would detract from the random, positive nature of the messages. </p>
											<p>Phone calls are tricky and more time intensive – if the recipient answers the phone, the conversation can quickly (and naturally) veer beyond the caring message. Some people will feel obligated to answer the phone, and others may feel guilty for missing your calls. If they answer, what was intended to be a short message may become a lengthy phone call.  </p>
											<p>Two-way text messages have been very successful in multiple Caring Contacts studies, especially with younger populations. This method scales very well and has the benefit of being responsive, meaning messages can be sent/received instantly. If you utilize 2-way text messages, you’ll need to be staffed to reply to recipients. </p>
										

										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Determine Message Authors</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Your organization will also need to decide who will send the Caring Contacts to the recipients, that is, who are the “authors” of the Caring Contacts.</p>
											<p>You might be considering having authors sending Caring Contacts to their own patients or clients who they are working with. <b>Don’t Do It!</b> It's a good idea in theory, but it falls apart when you consider how well pre-programmed messages—set up days, weeks, or even months in advance—would need to align with your actual interactions with the recipient.</p>
											<p>Can you imagine having an emotional therapy session or having to say “we can’t do that” to a veteran for something that is beyond the scope of your program and then having a pre-programmed message arrive that day from you saying “Just wanted to text you a big HELLO. Hope your day is going well!” </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									
										
								<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Caring Contacts are best sent as a stand-alone intervention by the author.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>The author has no other ongoing relationship with the recipient – they are an independent person who is there just to be support and connection. This is what the successful research on Caring Contacts is based on. </p>
											<p>It is reasonable that using Caring Contacts as aftercare for a hospitalization or outpatient treatment would also be effective where the author knows the recipient but isn’t otherwise interacting with them </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>It doesn’t take much time to implement Caring Contacts so one author can serve many recipients, depending on the system you choose.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>In a large organization that hopes to deliver Caring Contacts to hundreds of patients or clients via an automated system, it would still require less than the equivalent time of one full time staff member to program, send, and respond to Caring Contacts. </p>
											<p>In a small organization with closer to 50 or 100 likely recipients, this could take just a few hours per week for one person using an excel sheet or ten to fifteen minutes a day using a web app.  </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Caring Contacts Authors don’t need a clinical degree or experience.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Each organization needs to use their judgment on authors based on their context and staff.</p> 
												<p>Research assistants supervised by a psychologist sent the original model of Caring Contacts, and this has been replicated in other Caring Contacts studies that have demonstrated success. </p> 
												<p>Peers, mentors, leaders, or elders within a community might be much more powerful and meaningful authors from the recipient’s perspective. </p> 
												<p>The vast majority of replies to Caring Contacts are positive (e.g., thanks to much, 😀, or “same to you”), with some statements of distress that don’t suggest a crisis (e.g., things aren’t great – got laid off) or requests for resources. </p> 
												<p>Later in this toolkit we provide examples of replies that your team members can send in a variety of circumstances. </p>
												<p>Across multiple studies, crisis replies or “suicide note” replies occur extremely rarely (less than 1%), so they can be handled in consultation with a clinician who doesn’t need designated effort to the Caring Contacts program. </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>"Senders" – when someone other than the Author does the work to send the Caring Contacts</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>In large systems like the VA, an administrative or other assistant (the “sender”) can support clinicians who are Authoring messages. This can look like addressing and stamping postal mail, setting up mail merges to send all the messages for that day, programming the messages for new recipients into an Excel sheet or online messaging platform, etc.  </p>
											<p>Technology can replace this effort as described in our messaging platform   </p>
											<p>If someone is assigned as the Sender, there needs to be a plan for how the Author receives replies and responds. Will the Author dictate their response for the Sender to send, or will replies go directly to the Author’s phone? There are several options. </p>
										</div>
									</section>
								</div>
								<p>Regardless of whether Caring Contacts are pre-programmed and sent by a Sender or technology, you will need to establish processes for the Author to stay engaged. You will want a way to alert them when they are sending what messages, so they are ready for possible replies. For instance, an email that says, “You are sending 4 messages today; click here to see what is being sent to whom.” </p>

							<img src="images/header image 2.png" class="image fit">
							<h2 id="2">Chapter 2. Develop the Message Schedule</h2>
							<h3 id="2Length">Intervention Length</h3>
							<p>You’ll need to decide how many messages to send, how often to send them, and for how many months or years. These are your choices; there is no single standard.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Based on our interviews with Caring Contacts recipients in research studies, they report being happy with the number of messages they receive, whether 11 or up to 25.</li> 

								<li>Typically, organizations send between 8 and 25 messages over the course of 6 to 18 months, but we recommend a minimum of 12 months.  </li>

								<li>Consider more frequent messages at the beginning and tapering off toward the end (e.g., Next Day, then Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,8,10, 12 and their birthday)</li>

								<li><i>Note: we sometimes hear from participants that they notice when the messages taper off and wonder why they aren’t receiving as many Caring Contacts as they used to. One recommendation from our lived experience with suicide advisors is to subtly inform participants of the taper through the Caring Contacts and remind them know they can continue to reach out in between messages if they want or need additional support. </i></li>

								<li>Consider the platform you have selected to deliver Caring Contacts. Text message schedules might be more appropriate to concentrate more frequently at the start of the intervention (e.g., weekly) than postal mail, which may make sense to spread out more evenly.  </li>

								<li>For recipients at risk for suicide, we recommend a message soon after identification for the program (e.g., after an initial meeting or assessment with the Author), such as the next business day.  In previous studies where the first message arrived a month later, some recipients at risk for suicide had already re-attempted before the intervention could reach them. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3 id="2Content">Principles of Non-demanding Caring Contact Message Content</h3>

							<p>This is key for Authors to consider.</p> 
							<p><!--<span class="image right"><img src="images/flat iPhone.png" alt=""></span>-->In following the principle of being non-demanding, messages should just be kind reminders that we are thinking of them and emphasize care, support, and inclusion. </p>
							<p>This follows Motto’s 4 key principles described in the <a href="GDM1.html">background section</a> to stay true to the Caring Contacts model. </p>
							
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>So, avoid messages that ask or demand anything.</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>For example, advice like “be kind to yourself” or “exercise can be helpful” may be said with supportive intent but is often are experienced by stressed or distressed individuals as demands – “if I could be kind to myself, I wouldn’t be suicidal” or “as if I’m not stressed enough - now I’m supposed to exercise?!”).  </p>
										<p>There are times that your recipient might be having an awful day, and getting a, "Have a good day!" message could make them feel worse! Try “I hope you are having a good day” instead of “Have a good day!” </p>
										<p>Avoid sentiments like, "I want you to believe in yourself," which puts the responsibility on them. </p>
										<p>Similarly, appointment reminders can often distract from the Caring Contacts message or a reminder of something they don’t want to or must do.   </p>
									</div>
								</section>
							</div>
							<p>The general approach in Caring contacts is to welcome and invite replies to messages but not to expect or demand this – so you may want to include comments such as, “if you would like to respond, I’d be happy to hear from you” or equivalent in various messages from the pre-programmed list.   </p>
							<p>Your team should develop your own messages to ensure that they appropriately reflect and respect your local culture(s) and context(s). Here are some thoughts to consider:  </p>
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Emphasize personal connections as much as possible.  </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>This is admittedly a tricky task as many organizations have implemented Caring Contacts with pre-scheduled message systems and/or staff send Caring Contacts to those they don't know.  </p>
										<p>Taking time to compose a few genuinely compassionate messages will go a long way toward building rapport.  </p>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Avoid assuming they aren’t doing ok </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>While your organization may predominantly serve populations which are at increased risk of experiencing stressors, hardship, or instability, we don’t want to assume that they are always having a bad day. Additionally, suicide risk and mood can fluctuate significantly, even within a few hours. </p>
										<p>That said, we do try to avoid just sending, “Hope you’re doing ok,” "I hope your day is going well," etc. as those can feel very surface-level on their own. So,</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Don't JUST send "hope you're ok", try to pair it with another caring sentiment. </li>
											<li>Try not to use that phrase in every single message. </li>
										</ul>
										<p>Always emphasize what you know to be true which is that <b>You care about them, and you are there for them, even when things are hard.   </b></p>

										<h4>Avoid “Thinking of you” messages</h4>

									<div class="content">
										<p>Both adolescents and adults reacted poorly to Caring Contacts messages that included “Thinking of you” sentiments – they interpreted this as “creepy”, especially – but not only – when the Author was older than they were or of the opposite sex. </p>

										<h4>Keep it simple </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>We have found that authors often feel compelled to make their messages longer or “more meaningful” in some way, but it is unclear that doing so makes for a better message.  </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Longer Message Example: “We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes the butterfly had to go through to achieve that beauty.” - Maya Angelou. We, too, go through many changes. Hope you are having a good day. - Sasha </li>

										<h4>The First message: </h4>
										
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p class="major">Here are some ideas that we have found helpful in crafting the first Caring Contact you send. </p>
										<p>Your team should establish the monitoring hours, within which the team can respond, whether every day from 9 to 5 or specific days or times of the week. These hours should be included in the first message so that recipients will be aware, and participants should be gently reminded of the response hours if they reply afterhours, for example, “I’m so glad you reached out but I am just now seeing your text, I’m sorry! I am only able to view messages you send between 9am and 5pm.”</p>
										<p>Additionally, it may be good to remind participants that this intervention does not serve as a substitute for a 24-hour crisis line. </p>
										<p>Depending on the constraints of your chosen implementation platform, we encourage you to ask the recipient to respond to their first message so you know they received it and can reply. Then, you can, in turn, respond with an individualized response to demonstrate that you can receive and will respond personally to their messages.</p>
										<p>As this is a request (demanding), it should be considered in terms of Motto’s principles. We believe the benefit of them seeing the two-way communication in action is worth the small demand for text messaging platforms, but this is optional and not required.</p>
										<ul class="alt">
											<li>Example of initial Caring Contacts text message: </li>
											<li>[Text 1/2]: Hi [name], my name is [name] with the [Organization Name] Team. I'll be texting you over the next year to send kind words your way and remind you that I care about how you’re doing. I am here to support you – [my team and I are available Monday – Friday 9-5], so I won’t see messages sent outside of those hours right away. Please feel welcome (but never pressured) to reply or share anything on your mind. I'm so glad we have this chance to connect! <br/> [Text 2/2]: Even though we do not personally know each other, I truly value your wellbeing and I want the best for you. If you would like to have a phone call so we can get to know one another, I’d be happy to schedule something with you. No pressure either way. :)  
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Suggested Strategies to follow throughout the intervention:</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>If you are sending Caring Contacts by postal mail, consider enclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope or other information such as a phone number or address they can use to respond to shows you welcome a response as Motto did. </p>
										<p>To prevent messages from being perceived by recipients as automated or “spammy,” you should send the messages at varying times of day and at varying intervals between messages. </p>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>The Last message:</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Make sure that the last message to says it is the last message. </p>
										<p>Research has shown that participants like to be told that their messages will be ending. </p>
										<p>Some studies have mentioned that the intervention will be coming to an end in the second to last message, so that recipients have time to process and perhaps reach out if they feel they need more support.  </p>
										<p>Consider including directions for future contact or appropriate resources in case the recipient wants to get back in touch or needs further support.</p>
										<ul class="alt">
											<li>Example of Last Caring Contacts text message:</li>
											<li>“Hi [name], I have truly enjoyed being in touch over the past year! Please remember that you can always reach out to 988 for support, and know that I’m rooting for you!” </li>

							<h3 id="2Messages">Tailor Messages to the Audience</h3>
							<p>Your organization might consider culturally adapting the messages you team will send to fit the personalities, preferences, and dispositions of your specific client population (e.g., veterans, active-duty military, healthcare workers, American Indian/Alaska Native communities, Hispanic/Latino, older adults, youth, etc.)  </p>
							<ul>
								<li>We recommend starting by reviewing our sample lists of pre-programmed Caring Contacts with your team. You can do an exercise of giving everyone the samples and having everyone select or write messages to get the discussion moving.</li>
								<li>You might also meet with representatives of your customers/clients/patients in the same way to gather their reactions to the options. </li>
								<li>Be sure to check your pre-programmed messages against the Caring Contacts principles to be sure they stay in fidelity with the intervention </li>
							</ul>
							<p>Within a Caring Contacts program where multiple people will be “authors” of the messages, each author may want to write their own pre-programmed messages based on the Caring Contacts message principles but reflecting their own style and turn of phrase </p>
							<p>This adds complexity with multiple versions of the pre-programmed messages within an organization but is easily managed in online texting platforms such as Mosio and may feel more like a genuine human-to-human intervention. </p>
							<p>We’d also recommend reviewing this paper if you’d like more context on administering Caring Contacts. This is a review of about 10 studies of Caring Contacts with veteran and non-veteran participant samples.  </p>

								<h4>Concerns about negative responses to the intervention messages by a third-party</h4>
								<p>A specific situation has occurred very rarely (with about 3 participants out of over 1,500 across 4 research studies) which we would like to offer recommendations on how to prevent or resolve. </p>
								<p>There is a possibility that a recipient’s partner or someone else might see a Caring Contacts message and become distressed by it. In the few cases that have arisen, the recipient’s partner saw a kind, empathetic message on their phone and erroneously thought that their partner was getting romantic messages or that perhaps the recipient was cheating. </p>
								<p>Suggested strategies to prevent this situation from arising include: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Sending a link to your organization’s webpage at the end of the message: We don’t recommend sending the URL at the end of every message as it can come across as spam-like, but including it in the first message as well as occasionally throughout the remainer of the intervention period might be helpful. </li>
									<li>Suggesting to the recipient to add your organization name to the contact info for the message author, so that it’s obvious at a glance how the recipient might know the author. </li>
									<li>Referencing the organization’s name in the message itself: For example, “Hi, this is Joan from Sesame Street Clinic...” We still recommend that a message always be signed off by a real person’s name (e.g., not an anonymous or group sign-off), but including your organization’s name during or at the end of an initial Caring Contact message along with the author’s name can be helpful. </li>
									<li>Asking the recipient to share with their partner that they will be enrolled in a Caring Contacts program with your organization: This is recommended at the discretion of the author and the intervention team, but can be a very easy and direct way to establish the nature of the recipient’s relationship with their Caring Contacts author. </li>

								<h4>Specific recommendations for sending Caring Contacts to military veterans</h4>							
								<p>You may want to review different approaches to messages and different message content at the <a href="https://mirecc.va.gov/MIRECC/visn19/cpg/recs/13/">VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for Caring Contacts website</a>.</p>
								<p>There has been extensive research into the preferences of veterans for their Caring Contacts. Here we have summarized a few of the relevant studies which may provide more guidance as your organization develops your pre-scheduled messages. </p>
								<p>Survey of the preferences regarding physical Caring Contact letters by veteran patients admitted to an in-patient unit (these participants did not actually receive Caring Contacts). <b>In general, they found that some strong preferences were shown, and that demographic-specific preferences were not so strong that it would greatly impede intervention implementation.</b> There were minor differences between ages, genders, and races, but no differences between various numbers of combat deployment or military ranks. <i>(Keep in mind that only 18 of the 154 participants in this study were women, and over half were white.)</i></p>

							<h4>Mosio</h4>
							<p>Mosio for Caring Contacts is an online texting platform that has been optimized through user-centered design to support the administration of Caring Contacts to individuals in need of emotional support and ongoing connection.</p>
							<p>Our aim is to make sending Caring Contacts almost as effortless as receiving them. Mosio for CC securely tracks all the necessary details for a Caring Contacts intervention, ensuring that the correct messages are sent to the appropriate individuals as scheduled. It alerts you with a secure link to key information to know what to do when someone responds. Mosio allows for secure replies from both phones and computers, and includes “click to call” functionality to facilitate phone calls as needed. </p>
							<p>At this time, this platform that we have developed in partnership with Mosio is the only fully capable system we are aware of that can facilitate the delivery of the intervention according to the guidelines shared in this toolkit. </p>
									
								

							<h3 id="3Manual">Create a Manual System: Design and Develop Your Own Manual System </h3>
							<p>Caring Contacts has also been implemented via methods which require less overhead cost but may require higher costs for fidelity and adherence over time. These strategies may be more accessible for organizations with smaller client bases or where the ratio of authors to recipients is much higher. Message schedules can be built in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and the messages can be manually scheduled and delivered via email or text message. With these implementation strategies, there is substantially more work and monitoring required to ensure that the messages are delivered and responded to in a timely manner. </p>

									<header>
										<h4>Method and plan for how authors will respond to replies from recipients </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Responses to replies from recipients should be individualized natural responses from the author  </p>
										<p>Since many responses are pretty standard, standard text in the author’s voice can be prepared that can be sent as-is or edited can reduce the time for author to prepare a response – e.g., a message that has contact information for crisis help, a message that clarifies how to re-engage with care </p>
										<p>Be very cautious about autoreplies with crisis information. This may seem like a good idea to authors who are concerned the person is at risk but may be received as uncaring  </p>
										<ul>
											<li>May be experienced as spam or automation that tells the participant there isn’t a real person sending messages, which leads the recipient to disregard the messages or choose not to reply in the future </li>
											<li>This message implies the person is in crisis that they need this sent to them. Even for people who are highly suicidal, suicidal thoughts and feelings change through the day and throughout the week. Many Caring Contacts arrive when someone is doing fine as can be seen by the majority of replies being positive.  </li>
											<li>If someone says “hey, thanks for this – things are good” and an auto-response reminding them where to call if they are in crisis may be very invalidating. A reply of a happy face that doesn’t arrive till the next day is a much better fit </li>
										</ul>
										<p>If there is a sender assisting the author to send the messages, the sender may be the one tracking replies and can have the author dictate a response they can send to the recipient </p>

							<h3 id="5Individuals">Identify & Enroll Individuals</h3>
							<p>Based on the intervention enrollment criteria that your team decided on when planning the intervention, you’ll need to create a process through which individual recipients are "assigned" to start getting Caring Contacts. This may occur through routine screenings, referrals between case workers, or other workflows. </p>
							<p>Once potential recipients are identified, your team may want to reach out to those clients and confirm their willingness to participate. Then, follow the enrollment steps for whatever system you’re using. [link to section on Mosio/ISACC specific instructions for those that are using our system] </p>

											<p>Remember that the messages should appear as if they were individually sent by your team and come across as naturally as possible. Avoid having all of your messages come on the same day or time each week as this can look like spam.  </p>
											<p>If your messages will be coming from an unrecognized number, you may want to explain this to the recipient and even have them add the number from the initial contact to their Address Book with yours or your organization’s name so they recognize it in the future. </p>

							<h2 id="6">Chapter 6. Running the Intervention</h2>
							<p>This is not an automated intervention. There’s a real relationship whether or not the author has met the recipient. The recipient should expect the author is paying attention to their replies and that the author will be sending the messages thoughtfully and with care.</p>
							<p>If the author becomes aware of new information about the recipient based on replies or other information, the next scheduled message might need to be changed accordingly</p>
							<div class="box">	
								<p>For example, if they replied to a message that their father died, the next scheduled message a few weeks should probably be modified from something like, “hope all is well with you.”  </p>

							<p>Your organization is responsible for monitoring and responding to all incoming messages from your recipients (what we call “replies” to differentiate from what you send which we call “responses”). Here are some points to consider in planning your Caring Contacts program: </p>

										<h3 id="6Replies">Replies from Recipients</h3>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
											<p>This is a two-way communication intervention, so recipients can reply at any time.  </p>
											<p>Outgoing scheduled contacts are often sent earlier in the day to maximize the chance that replies come during that author’s business hours. </p>
											<p>The intention is that the messages are non-demanding, so pre-programmed messages are statements of care, concern, and support that don’t require a reply. </p>
											<p>To the extent that the author does not want to encourage an extended dialogue, the author can plan a delay of 1-2 hours when responding to messages containing positive or neutral content. </p>
											<ul>
												<li>In our previous study, the mean number of messages back and forth, including the pre-programmed message that opened the exchange, was 3.5.) </li>
												<li>Nonetheless, 67% of the time in our text message study, participants replied to at least one message.  The majority were positive or neutral or an emoji that required a comparable simple, polite response, but not immediately. </li>

										<h3 id="6Recipients">Responding to Recipients</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Replies to at least some of the pre-programmed Caring Contacts are expected. In our experience the vast majority of responses tend to simply show gratitude (“thanks so much”) or reciprocity (“I hope you have a good day too”) or something general like a thumbs-up emoji.  </p>
											<p>In the minority of situations, the reply will indicate distress or request assistance. This may occur when they are getting Caring Contacts and no other services from your organization, so this offers an opportunity to support someone who is in distress that might otherwise be missed. </p>
											<p>Not responding to a recipient’s reply may well be taken as either uncaring or that Caring Contacts are from a bot, spam, or otherwise disingenuous, so it is important to reply.  </p>
											<p>Responses do not have to be immediate. It is important to orient recipients at the beginning of the program about how long they can expect to wait for a response. It can also be strategic to let time pass before responding if the organization is less interested in getting into a text dialogue with the recipient. It is common in our programs to hold “by next business day” as a standard for a reply that does not indicate distress. Programs vary in how quickly a response is expected if the message indicates distress or risk. Agencies are advised to follow their existing crisis response protocols. </p>
											<p>Caring Contacts is a behavioral health intervention but not intended to function as a crisis line. Recipients should be oriented up front about when to expect a response and when not to. It is important to communicate in advance what recipients should do if they need help at a time no one can respond. We have found that recipients are flexible and respectful of this, and it has not been an issue. </p>
											<p>For the majority of replies, the author is just responding with an emoji or a “You’re welcome” or a “That’s great!” or a “Hoping things keep getting better this week”… </p>
											<p>When someone sounds like things are tough but not anything emergent, the typical response is a message of validation and caring. When appropriate, a separate second message is sent, assuring the recipient is aware of relevant resources, formal support or crisis resources they can follow-up with (if they choose). </p>
											<p>Most authors/agencies’ initial concern is responding to recipient replies after hours and on weekends.  Most clinics do not respond to recipient contacts at those times, instead orienting recipients on what to do when the clinic is closed.  We argue the same should be true for Caring Contacts, which is a long-term psychosocial intervention, not a crisis intervention.  In our study, the vast majority of messages came during work hours and it was cost-inefficient to have authors (or a backup clinician) on call for the 38% of the 1% of messages that were time-sensitive that came outside of business hours. </p>
											<p>A common strategy for managing after-hours replies is an “autoreply” or “out of office” message that includes who to call in a crisis.  However, the vast majority of responses are positive or neutral, e.g., a happy face or thank you to a message that said, “Hope you are doing well.” We are concerned that such a response is invalidating, is inappropriate for 99% of replies, and will communicate that we expect them to be in crisis. Individuals with lived experience of suicidality on one study’s advisory board did not like this idea at all. </p>

							<h2 id="7">Chapter 7. End of Intervention Plan</h2>
							<p>Your team should already have planned out what the last message will contain. Following the end of an intervention period for a given recipient, there will be some important points to consider: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Where should the recipient turn for reconnection with your organization or immediate assistance now that Caring Contacts are over? </li>
								<li>Will recipients be able to re-enroll in the intervention? </li>
								<li>How might your team gather feedback on the intervention which they received?  </li>
							</ul>
							<p>We recommend administering a short survey about their experience getting the intervention. Here’s an example you can use or modify to fit your organizations needs <a href="https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/center_for_suicide_prevention_and_recovery/Shared%20Documents/Research%20Projects/FTF%20-%20COVE%20%26%20ISACC%20Pilot/Caring%20Contacts%20via%20ISACC%20Toolkit/Toolkit%20development/File%20attachments/Caring%20Contacts%20Reception%20Survey%202025.docx?d=wbfd7f52569324f68b23dc05cc3edd91c&csf=1&web=1&e=WPVrAR">Caring Contacts Reception Survey 2025</a></p>
