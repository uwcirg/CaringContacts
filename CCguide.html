							<h2>&nbsp</h2><h1>Practical Guide to Sending Caring Contacts </h1>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Let’s get started implementing Caring Contacts in your organization! This guide offers advice and recommendations for all phases of design, planning, and implementation, along with guidance on how to manage day-to-day implementation challenges. We’ve also provided decision support tools, pre-scheduled message templates, and quick-reference guides for your team to use, as well as links to further information and interactive trainings. </p>
							<p>Here’s some terms you should know:</p>
							<div class="items style3 medium">
								<section class="feature">
									<p><b>Author:</b> the person from whom the Caring Contacts are sent – whose name and responsibility is the Caring Contacts for their clients.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<p><b>Recipient:</b>  the person who is receiving the messages</p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<p><b>Sender:</b> a person who does the work to send the Caring Contacts who is not the Author, if any</p>

							<h2 id="1">1. Structure Caring Contacts Intervention: Designing to fit your organization</h2>
							<h3 id="1Population">Identify Population</h3>
							<p>Your organization will need to decide which of your clients/patients should receive the intervention – that is, who are the <b>“recipients”</b> of the Caring Contacts. This will be highly dependent on the population you serve and what their needs and desires are.</p>
							<p>Perhaps,</p>
							<div class="items style3 big">
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2> 
									<p>You want to send them to individuals tied to a particular event (e.g., patients who are discharged from the hospital, clients who completed behavioral health treatment, veterans who stopped attending programming, first responders working during a pandemic, a service member who seeks help with suicidal thoughts) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-star" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them based on a rating scale or measure of stress or distress (e.g., veterans who are unemployed or unhoused, patients who report depression or suicidality on a rating scale, staff who report high burnout) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-end" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them to all participants in your program or at the completion of your program (e.g., send to veterans after a women’s retreat for PTSD, patients after an intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization program, crisis line callers, Employee Assistance program for burnout) </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<h2><i class="fa-solid fa-hand-holding-medical" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i></h2>
									<p>You might want to send them to people who were uninterested or unable to participate in treatments you recommend (e.g., patients experiencing suicidality but uninterested in psychotherapy or medications, rape survivors who could come to treatment any time but can’t face it right now) </p>
								</section>
							</div>
						
							<p class="major"><b>The Caring Contacts Intervention can be implemented via emails, texts, physical mail, and phone calls. Digital options such as email and text are familiar to the recipient and are easy to track.  </b></p>
							<p>While it can be more cost-efficient and timesaving to send Caring Contacts through email or texts, it has been theorized that physical mail might carry a certain emotional impact that digital communication does not. While phone calls have been previously tested, they require a greater workload for the organization and can lead to conversations that veer away from the Caring Contacts message. Our team has found that the majority of participants prefer to be contacted via written communication. </p>
							<h3 id="1Message">Message Format & Medium</h3>
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
										<header>
											<h4>How do you want to send the messages?</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Best evidence is for postal mail and text messages</p>
											<p>Study with email was not successful; perhaps because email has become more about business communication, bills, and spam and less about personal communication</p> 
											<p>Medical systems have considered using eCare, MyChart, or similar options to send the Caring Contacts, which to them seems simple and appealing, but for the recipient, is neither. They will get a message that requires them to login to the system only to arrive at a message that says, “Hope you are doing well.”  We doubt that recipients will have the simple positive response that is intended after the trouble of typing the login and password (especially on their phones), and we suspect they might just stop opening eCare messages.</p>
											<p>Phone calls are tricky – if you don’t get voicemail then you are now in a conversation that can quickly (and naturally) veers to other things than the caring message. </p>
										

										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>What platform will you use to track and send the pre-programmed messages?</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Text messages can be sent through a web-app that sends pre-programmed messages on schedule</p>
												<p>Postal mail can be tracked with an excel sheet and staff to keep track of when to send letters by hand </p> 
												<p>Postal mail can also be tracked in an app and pre-programmed letters send via a contract with a postal service </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>How do you want to manage replies from recipients?</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Postal mail can include either a self-addressed stamped envelope or a phone number included if the person wants to respond </p>
												<p>Text messages can be sent through a web-app that receive replies and through which you can respond </p>
												<p>You can tell them you cannot respond – but this is not recommended as likely to feel less caring and, to date, no study has shown a benefit to this method</p>
										</div>
									</section>
							</div>
							<h3 id="1Authors">Identify who will author the Caring Contacts intervention </h3>							
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Your organization will also need to decide who will send the Caring Contacts to the recipients, that is, who are the “authors” of the Caring Contacts.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>You might be considering having authors sending Caring Contacts to their own patients or clients who they are working with. <b>Don’t Do It!</b> It's a good idea in theory, but it falls apart when you consider how well pre-programmed messages—set up days, weeks, or even months in advance—would need to align with your actual interactions with the recipient.</p>
											<p>Can you imagine having an emotional therapy session or having to say “we can’t do that” to a veteran for something that is beyond the scope of your program and then having a pre-programmed message arrive that day from you saying “Just wanted to text you a big HELLO. Hope your day is going well!” </p>
										</div>
									</section>
								<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Caring Contacts are best sent as a stand-alone intervention by the author.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>The author has no other ongoing relationship with the recipient – they are an independent person who is there just to be support and connection. This is what the successful research on Caring Contacts is based on. </p>
											<p>It is reasonable that using Caring Contacts as aftercare for a hospitalization or outpatient treatment would also be effective where the author knows the recipient but isn’t otherwise interacting with them </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>It doesn’t take much time to implement Caring Contacts so one author can serve many recipients.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>In a large organization with thousands of patients or clients, a substantial amount of staff time might be given to one or two people to program, send, and respond to Caring Contacts with hundreds of recipients </p>
											<p>In a small organization with closer to  50 or 100 likely recipients, this could take just a few hours per week for one person. </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>Caring Contacts Authors don’t need a clinical degree or experience.</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Each organization needs to use their judgment on authors based on their context and staff</p> 
												<p>Research assistants supervised by a psychologist sent the original model of Caring Contacts, and this has been replicated in other Caring Contacts studies that have demonstrated success </p> 
												<p>Peers, mentors, leaders, or elders within a community might be much more powerful and meaningful authors from the recipient’s perspective </p> 
												<p>The vast majority of replies to Caring Contacts are positive (e.g., thanks to much, 😀, or “same to you”), with some statements of distress that don’t suggest a crisis (e.g., things aren’t great – got laid off) or requests for resources </p> 
												<p>Across multiple studies, crisis replies or “suicide note” replies occur extremely rarely (less than X%), so they can be handled in consultation with a clinician who doesn’t need designated effort to the Caring Contacts program </p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h4>"Senders" – when someone other than the Author does the work to send the Caring Contacts</h4>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>In large systems like the VA, an administrative or other assistant (the “sender”) can support clinicians who are Authoring messages. This can look like addressing and stamping postal mail, setting up mail merges to send all the messages for that day, programming the messages for new recipients into an Excel sheet or online messaging platform, etc.  </p>
											<p>Technology can replace this effort as described in our messaging platform   </p>
											<p>If someone is assigned as the Sender, there needs to be a plan for how the Author receives replies and responds. Will the Author dictate their response for the Sender to send, or will replies go directly to the Author’s phone? There are several options. </p>
										</div>
									</section>
								</div>
								<p>Regardless of whether Caring Contacts are pre-programmed and sent by a Sender or technology, you will need to establish processes for the Author to stay engaged. You will want a way to alert them when they are sending what messages, so they are ready for possible replies. For instance, an email that says, “You are sending 4 messages today; click here to see what is being sent to whom” </p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section class="wrapper style1 content-align-left color1">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2 id="2">2. Develop the Message Schedule</h2>
							<h3 id="2Length">Intervention Length</h3>
							<p>You’ll need to decide how many messages to send, how often to send them, and for how many months or years. These are your choices; there is no single standard.  </p>
							<ul>
								<li> Based on our interviews with Caring Contacts recipients in research studies, they report being happy with the number of messages they receive, whether 11 or up to 25.   </li> 

								<li>Typically, organizations send between 8 and 25 messages over the course of 6 to 18 months, but we recommend a minimum of 12 months.  </li>

								<li>Consider more frequent messages at the beginning and tapering off toward the end (e.g., Next Day, then Month 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,8,10, 12 and their birthday)  </li>

								<li>Consider the message form. Text message schedules might feel more comfortable if sent more often at the start (e.g., weekly) than postal mail.  </li>

								<li>For suicidal recipients, we recommend a message soon after identification for the program (e.g., after an initial meeting or assessment with the Author), such as the next day or next week.  In previous studies where the first message arrived a month later, some suicidal recipients had already re-attempted before the intervention could reach them. </li>
							</ul>
							<h3 id="2Content">Principles of Non-demanding Caring Contact Message Content</h3>

							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/flat iPhone.png" alt=""></span>In following the principle of being non-demanding, messages should just be kind reminders that we are thinking of them and emphasize care, support, and inclusion. </p>
							<p>This follows Motto’s 4 key principles described in the <a href="GDM1.html">background section</a> to stay true to the Caring Contacts model. </p>
							
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>So, avoid messages that ask or demand anything.</h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>For example, advice like “be kind to yourself” or “exercise can be helpful” may be said with supportive intent but is often are experienced by stressed or distressed individuals as demands – “if I could be kind to myself, I wouldn’t be suicidal” or “as if I’m not stressed enough - now I’m supposed to exercise?!”).  </p>
										<p>Even avoid sentiments like, "I want you to believe in yourself," which puts the responsibility on them. </p>
										<p>Similarly, appointment reminders can often distract from the Caring Contacts message or a reminder of something they don’t want to or must do.   </p>
									</div>
								</section>
							</div>
							<p>The general approach in Caring contacts is to welcome and invite replies to messages but not to expect or demand this – so you may want to include comments such as, “if you would like to respond, I’d be happy to hear from you” or equivalent in various messages from the pre-programmed list.   </p>
							<p>Your team should develop your own messages to ensure that they appropriately reflect and respect your local culture(s) and context(s). Here are some thoughts to consider:  </p>
							<div class="index align-left">
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Emphasize personal connections as much as possible.  </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>This is admittedly a tricky task as many organizations have implemented Caring Contacts with pre-scheduled message systems and/or staff send Caring Contacts to those they don't know.  </p>
										<p>Taking time to compose a few genuinely compassionate messages will go a long way toward building rapport.  </p>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Avoid “Hope you’re doing ok”! </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>We try to avoid just saying, “Hope you’re doing ok,” "I hope your day is going well," etc. as those can feel very surface-level </p>
										<p>We also don't want to assume that their day is going well. The recipient might be having an awful day, and getting a "Hope you're well" message could make them feel worse! </p>
										<p>Rather than sending “I hope you’re well”, emphasize what you know to be true:   </p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>You care about them, and you are there for them, even when things are hard.   </b></li>
											<li>Consider doing this rather than just saying, "Hope you're good!" or  </li>
											<li>We've often gotten positive responses to messages that acknowledged how things might be hard or that they might be going through a tough time but that we believe in them.   </li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Keep it simple </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>We have found that authors often feel compelled to make their messages longer or “more meaningful” in some way, but it is unclear that doing so makes for a better message.  </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Longer Message Example: “We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes the butterfly had to go through to achieve that beauty.” - Maya Angelou. We, too, go through many changes. Hope you are having a good day. - Sasha </li>
											<li>Shorter Message Example: [name], you have overcome so much! I believe you’re going to do great things! - Alan  </li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</section>
								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>The First message: </h4>
										<p>Here are some ideas that we have found helpful in crafting the first Caring Contact you send. </p>
									</header>

										<p>Your team should also establish the monitoring hours, within which the team can respond, whether every day from 9 to 5 or specific days or times of the week. These hours should be included in the first message so that recipients will be aware. </p>
										<p>Additionally, it may be good to remind participants that this intervention does not serve as a substitute for a 24-hour crisis line. </p>
										<p>Depending on the constraints of your chosen implementation platform, we encourage you to ask the recipient to respond to their first message so you know they received it and can reply. Then, you can, in turn, respond with an individualized response to demonstrate that you can receive and will respond personally to their messages.  </p>
										<p>As this is a request, it should be considered in terms of Motto’s principles. We believe the benefit of them seeing the two-way communication in action is worth the small demand for text messaging platforms.  </p>
										<p>However, to minimize the demand, we do not persistently remind recipients to reply to the first Caring Contact (beyond the original request to confirm receipt of the first message). </p>

										<h4>Other message suggestions: </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>If you are sending Caring Contacts by postal mail, consider enclosing a self-addressed stamped envelope or other information such as a phone number or address they can use to respond to shows you welcome a response as Motto did.</p>
										<p>To prevent messages from being perceived by recipients as automated or “spammy,” you may want to send the messages at varying times of day and at varying intervals between messages rather than a set day and time. </p>
										<p>If your team wants every recipient to get the same number of messages, you will want to make sure that if a recipient’s birthday or any relevant holidays or seasonal messages occurs during the projected Caring Contacts period, one of the existing scheduled messages is replaced by the birthday/holiday message.   </p>

										<p>Do you want the last message to say it is the last message?  </p>
										<p>Research has shown that participants like to be told that their messages will be ending. </p>
										<p>Some studies have mentioned that the intervention will be coming to an end in the second to last message, so that recipients have time to process and perhaps reach out if they feel they need more support. </p>
										<p>Consider including directions for future contact in case the recipient wants to get back in touch. </p>

							<h3 id="2Messages">Tailor Messages to the Audience</h3>
							<p>Your organization/agency might consider culturally adapting the messages you team will send to fit the personalities, preferences, and dispositions of your diverse client population (e.g., veterans, active duty military, healthcare workers, American Indian/Alaska Native communities, Hispanic/Latino youth, etc.)  </p>
							<ul>
								<li>A team brainstorming session might clarify issues. We recommend reviewing our sample lists of pre-programmed Caring Contacts as a group. You can do an exercise of giving everyone the samples and having everyone select or write messages to get the discussion moving </li>
								<li>You might also meet with representatives of your customers/clients/patients in the same way to gather their reactions to the options. </li>
								<li>Be sure to check your message list against the Caring Contacts principles to be sure they stay in fidelity with the intervention </li>
							</ul>
							<p>Within a Caring Contacts program where multiple people will be “authors” of the messages, each author may want to write their own pre-programmed messages based on the Caring Contacts message principles but reflecting their own style and turn of phrase </p>
							<ul>
								<li>This adds complexity with multiple versions of the pre-programmed lists within an organization </li>
								<li>On the other hand, it maximizes Caring Contacts as a genuine human-to-human intervention </li>
							</ul>
							<div class="box">
								<h4>Concerns about negative responses to the intervention messages by a third-party</h4>
								<p>A specific situation has occurred very rarely (with about 3 participants out of over 1,500 across 4 research studies) which we would like to offer recommendations on how to prevent or resolve. </p>
								<p>There is a possibility that a recipient’s partner or someone else might see a Caring Contacts message and become distressed by it. In the few cases that have arisen, the recipient’s partner saw a kind, empathetic message on their phone and erroneously thought that their partner was getting romantic messages or that perhaps the recipient was cheating. </p>
								<p>Suggested strategies to prevent this situation from arising include: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Sending a link to your organization’s webpage at the end of the message: We don’t recommend sending the URL at the end of every message as it can come across as spam-like, but including it in the first message as well as occasionally throughout the remainer of the intervention period might be helpful. </li>
									<li>Suggesting to the recipient to add your organization name to the contact info for the message author, so that it’s obvious at a glance how the recipient might know the author. </li>
									<li>Referencing the organization’s name in the message itself: For example, “Hi, this is Joan from Sesame Street Clinic...” We still recommend that a message always be signed off by a real person’s name (e.g., not an anonymous or group sign-off), but including your organization’s name during or at the end of a message along with the author’s name can be helpful. </li>
									<li>Asking the recipient to share with their partner that they will be enrolled in a Caring Contacts program with your organization: This is recommended at the discretion of the author and the intervention team, but can be a very easy and direct way to establish the nature of the recipient’s relationship with their Caring Contacts author. </li>

								<h4>Specific recommendations for sending Caring Contacts to military veterans</h4>							
								<p>You may want to review different approaches to messages and different message content at the <a href="https://mirecc.va.gov/MIRECC/visn19/cpg/recs/13/">VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for Caring Contacts website</a>.</p>
								<p>There has been extensive research into the preferences of veterans for their Caring Contacts. Here we have summarized a few of the relevant studies which may provide more guidance as your organization develops your pre-scheduled messages. </p>
								<p>Survey of the preferences regarding physical Caring Contact letters by veteran patients admitted to an in-patient unit (these participants did not actually receive Caring Contacts). <b>In general, they found that some strong preferences were shown, and that demographic-specific preferences were not so strong that it would greatly impede intervention implementation.</b> There were minor differences between ages, genders, and races, but no differences between various numbers of combat deployment or military ranks. <i>(Keep in mind that only 18 of the 154 participants in this study were women, and over half were white.)</i></p>

									<h4>Mosio/new ISACC</h4>
									<p>[Platform] is a pioneering informatics solution that seeks to optimize the administration of Caring Contacts to individuals in need of emotional support and ongoing connection. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we offer care to be proactive instead of reactive with the aim of cost-effectively improving mental health outcomes and overall well-being. We continue to gather valuable insights that inform decisions on how to refine [the platform], ensuring its maximum efficacy to provide compassionate and personalized care to those who need it most.  </p>
									<p>Our aim is to make sending Caring Contacts almost as effortless as receiving them. Though we may never fully achieve that, [this platform] securely tracks all the necessary details, ensuring that the correct messages are sent to the appropriate individuals at the right moment. It alerts you with a secure link to key information to know what to do when someone responds. [The platform] allows for secure replies from both phones and computers. </p>
								
									
								

							<h3 id="3Manual">Create a Manual System: Design and Develop Your Own Manual System </h3>
							<p>Caring Contacts has also been implemented via methods which require less overhead cost but may require higher costs for fidelity and adherence over time. These strategies may be more accessible for organizations with smaller client bases or where the ratio of authors to recipients is much higher. Message schedules can be built in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and the messages can be manually scheduled and delivered via email or text message. With these implementation strategies, there is substantially more work and monitoring required to ensure that the messages are delivered and responded to in a timely manner. </p>

								<section>
									<header>
										<h4>Method and plan for how authors will respond to replies from recipients </h4>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Responses to replies from recipients should be individualized natural responses from the author  </p>
										<p>Since many responses are pretty standard, standard text in the author’s voice can be prepared that can be sent as-is or edited can reduce the time for author to prepare a response – e.g., a message that has contact information for crisis help, a message that clarifies how to re-engage with care </p>
										<p>Be very cautious about autoreplies with crisis information. This may seem like a good idea to authors who are concerned the person is at risk but may be received as uncaring  </p>
										<ul>
											<li>May be experienced as spam or automation that tells the participant there isn’t a real person sending messages, which leads the recipient to disregard the messages or choose not to reply in the future </li>
											<li>This message implies the person is in crisis that they need this sent to them. Even for people who are highly suicidal, suicidal thoughts and feelings change through the day and throughout the week. Many Caring Contacts arrive when someone is doing fine as can be seen by the majority of replies being positive.  </li>
											<li>If someone says “hey, thanks for this – things are good” and an auto-response reminding them where to call if they are in crisis may be very invalidating. A reply of a happy face that doesn’t arrive till the next day is a much better fit </li>
										</ul>
										<p>If there is a sender assisting the author to send the messages, the sender may be the one tracking replies and can have the author dictate a response they can send to the recipient </p>

							<h3 id="5Individuals">Identify & Enroll Individuals</h3>
							<p>Based on the intervention enrollment criteria that your team decided on when planning the intervention, you’ll need to create a process through which individual recipients are "assigned" to start getting Caring Contacts. This may occur through routine screenings, referrals between case workers, or other workflows. </p>
							<p>Once potential recipients are identified, your team may want to reach out to those clients and confirm their willingness to participate.

							<h2 id="6">6. Running the Intervention</h2>
							<p>This is not an automated intervention. There’s a real relationship whether or not the author has met the recipient. The recipient should expect the author is paying attention to their replies and that the author will be sending the messages thoughtfully and with care. . </p>
							<p>See designing a manual Caring Contacts system for more sense of the Caring Contacts intervention flow and things to consider</p>

							<p>Your agency is responsible for monitoring and responding to all incoming messages from your recipients (what we call “replies” to differentiate from what you send which we call “responses”). Here are some points to consider in planning your Caring Contacts program: </p>

											<p>This is a two-way communication intervention, so recipients can reply at any time.  </p>
											<p>Outgoing scheduled contacts are often sent earlier in the day to maximize the chance that replies come during that author’s business hours. </p>
											<p>The intention is that the messages are non-demanding, so pre-programmed messages are statements of care, concern, and support that don’t require a reply. </p>
											<p>To the extent that the author does not want to encourage an extended dialogue, the author can plan a delay of 1-2 hours when responding to messages containing positive or neutral content. </p>
											<ul>
												<li>In our previous study, the mean number of messages back and forth, including the pre-programmed message that opened the exchange, was 3.5.) </li>
												<li>Nonetheless, 67% of the time in our text message study, participants replied to at least one message.  The majority were positive or neutral or an emoji that required a comparable simple, polite response, but not immediately. </li>

										<h3 id="6Recipients">Responding to Recipients</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>Replies to at least some of the pre-programmed Caring Contacts are expected. In our experience the vast majority of responses tend to simply show gratitude (“thanks so much”) or reciprocity (“I hope you have a good day too”) or something general like a thumbs-up emoji.  </p>
											<p>In the minority of situations, the reply will indicate distress or request assistance. This may occur when they are getting Caring Contacts and no other services from your agency, so this offers an opportunity to support someone who is in distress that might otherwise be missed. </p>
											<p>Not responding to a recipient’s reply may well be taken as either uncaring or that Caring Contacts are from a bot, spam, or otherwise disingenuous, so it is important to reply.  </p>
											<p>Responses do not have to be immediate. It is important to orient recipients at the beginning of the program about how long they can expect to wait for a response. It can also be strategic to let time pass before responding if the agency is less interested in getting into a text dialogue with the recipient. It is common in our programs to hold “by next business day” as a standard for a reply that does not indicate distress. Programs vary in how quickly a response is expected if the message indicates distress or risk. Agencies are advised to follow their existing crisis response protocols. </p>
											<p>Caring Contacts is a behavioral health intervention but not intended to function as a crisis line. Recipients should be oriented up front about when to expect a response and when not to. It is important to communicate in advance what recipients should do if they need help at a time no one can respond. We have found that recipients are flexible and respectful of this, and it has not been an issue. </p>
											<p>For the majority of replies, the author is just responding with an emoji or a “You’re welcome” or a “That’s great!” or a “Hoping things keep getting better this week”… </p>
											<p>When someone sounds like things are tough but not anything emergent, the typical response is a message of validation and caring. When appropriate, a separate second message is sent, assuring the recipient is aware of relevant resources, formal support or crisis resources they can follow-up with (if they choose). </p>
											<p>Most authors/agencies’ initial concern is responding to recipient replies after hours and on weekends.  Most clinics do not respond to recipient contacts at those times, instead orienting recipients on what to do when the clinic is closed.  We argue the same should be true for Caring Contacts, which is a long-term psychosocial intervention, not a crisis intervention.  In our study, the vast majority of messages came during work hours and it was cost-inefficient to have authors (or a backup clinician) on call for the 38% of the 1% of messages that were time-sensitive that came outside of business hours. </p>
											<p>A common strategy for managing after-hours replies is an “autoreply” or “out of office” message that includes who to call in a crisis.  However, the vast majority of responses are positive or neutral, e.g., a happy face or thank you to a message that said, “Hope you are doing well.” We are concerned that such a response is invalidating, is inappropriate for 99% of replies, and will communicate that we expect them to be in crisis. Individuals with lived experience of suicidality on one study’s advisory board did not like this idea at all. </p>

							<h2 id="7">7. End of Intervention Plan</h2>
							<p>Your team should already have planned out what the last message will contain. Following the end of an intervention period for a given recipient, there will be some important points to consider: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Where should the recipient turn for reconnection with your organization or immediate assistance now that Caring Contacts are over? </li>
								<li>Will recipients be able to re-enroll in the intervention? </li>
								<li>How might your team gather feedback on the intervention which they received?  </li>
							</ul>
							<p>We recommend administering a short survey about their experience getting the intervention. Here’s an example you can use or modify to fit your organizations needs Caring Contacts Reception Survey 2025 </p>
							<ul>
								<li>This can be sent to them to complete online or you can ask them to complete it during their next appointment/meeting </li>
								<li>This allows for more honest feedback </li>
								<li>Directly asking recipients their experiences is not recommended as participants might be unwilling to share their honest feedback if they feel it might hurt the author’s feelings. Asking them to complete the survey on their own allows more time for them to think through their answers. </li>
