							<h2>1. Develop Message Schedule</h2>
							<h3>Principles of Non-demanding Caring Contact Message Content</h3>

							<p>You should develop your own messages to ensure that they appropriately reflect and respect your local culture(s) and context(s). Here are some thoughts to consider:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The most important issue is that the messages follow Motto’s 4 key principles described in the background section to be true to the Caring Contacts model and avoid including things that have any demand to them. For example, advice like “be kind to yourself” or “exercise can be helpful” may be said with supportive intent but often are experienced by stressed or distressed individuals as demands – “if I could be kind to myself, I wouldn’t be suicidal” or “as if I’m not stressed enough - now I’m supposed to exercise?”).</li>
								<li>Similarly, appointment reminders can often be a distraction from the Caring Contacts message and a reminder of something they don’t want to or have to do.</li>
								<li>It can seem like another simple message conveying welcome, support, or care that doesn’t expect or demand anything from the recipient is not enough. We have found authors often feel compelled to make their messages longer or “more meaningful” in some way, but it is not clear that doing so makes for a better message.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Here are some ideas that we have found helpful in crafting Caring Contacts:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The general approach in Caring contacts is to welcome and invite replies to messages but not to expect or demand this – so you may want to include comments such as, “if you would like to respond, I’d be happy to hear from you” or equivalent in your CarePlan. </li>
								<li>Depending on the constraints of your chosen implementation platform, we encourage you to ask the recipient to respond just to their first message so you know they received it and that they can reply. Then you can, in turn, respond with an individualized response to demonstrate that you can receive and will respond personally to their messages. </li>
								<li>Your team should also establish the monitoring hours, within which the team is able to respond, whether that’s every day from 9 to 5, or specific days or times of the week. These hours should be included in the first message so that recipients will be aware.</li>
								<li>Messages should accommodate the time of the week – a message scheduled on Friday reads better as “hope you had a good week,” not “hope you are having a good week.”</li>
								<li>Since messages will be coming from an unrecognized number rather than an individual or agency phone number, you may want to explain this to the recipient and even have them add the number from the initial contact to their Address Book with yours or your agency’s name so they recognize it in the future.</li>
							</ul>
							<blockquote>We generally do not continue reminding recipients to reply to the first Caring Contact (beyond the original ask of them to confirm receipt of the first message) as it could be demanding. </blockquote>

							<h3>Identify who will get them</h3>
							<p></p>

							<h3>Tailor Messages to the Audience</h3>
							<p>Potentially, each agency/community might culturally adapt the messages (e.g., Veterans, active duty military, healthcare workers, American Indian/Alaska Native communities, Latinx youth) their organization will send.</p>
							<p>Additionally, within an organization, each author sending the messages may want to write their own pre-programmed messages based on the core message principles—so there could be multiple versions of the pre-programmed lists within and across organizations.</p>

							<h3>Decide how long and how often the messages will be sent</h3>
							<p>One of your first decisions is how many messages do you want to send, how often do you want to send the messages, and for how long. These are your choices.</p>
							<p>You may want to review different approaches to messages and different message content at the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for Caring Contacts website (https://mirecc.va.gov/MIRECC/visn19/cpg/recs/13/) In addition, the toolkit gives sample lists of messages of different content, frequency, and duration to help you decide. (link to schedule builder tool.)</p>
							<p>To prevent messages from being perceived by recipients as automated or “spammy,” you may want to send the messages at varying times of day and at varying intervals between messages rather than a set day and time. </p>

							<h2>2. Decide how to deliver the messages</h2>
							<h3>Options for Implementation</h3>
							<p class="major"><span class="image left"><img src="images/Lockscreen.png" alt=""></span>The Caring Contacts Intervention can be implemented via emails, texts, physical mail, and phone calls. Digital options such as email and text are familiar to the recipient, and are easy to track.</p>
							<p>While it can be more cost-efficient and timesaving to send Caring Contacts through email or texts, it has been theorized that physical mail might carry a certain emotional impact that digital communication does not. While phone calls have been previously tested, they require a greater workload for the organization. Our team has found that the majority of participants prefer to be contacted via written (text or email) communication. </p>
							<p>A primary consideration your team will need to take into account is if you are allowed to use an outside party’s program. For teams which are obligated to build their own delivery app, we have provided general guidance on the features and capabilities that are needed for a modern and effective intervention delivery service. </p>
							<h3>Decision Flow</h3>
							<p>Asking "Can you use tech outside of your system/an external app?"  

Why Choose an Existing Service: 

Adequate funding 

Flexibility with using outside systems 

Why Choose to build a system: 

Prevented from using outside systems 

In-house development team</p>
				
						
							<h3>Finding an Existing Caring Contacts Service</h3>

									<h3>Mosio/new ISACC</h3>
									<p>ISACC is a pioneering informatics solution that seeks to optimize the administration of Caring Contacts to individuals in need of emotional support and ongoing connection. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we offer care to be proactive instead of reactive with the aim of cost-effectively improving mental health outcomes and overall well-being. We continue to gather valuable insights that inform decisions on how to refine ISACC, ensuring its maximum efficacy to provide compassionate and personalized care to those who need it most. </p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<i class="fas fa-book" style="color: #FE8F3E;"></i>
									<h3>LifeWIRE</h3>
									<p>LifeWIRE is a platform that facilitates communication between clinics and patients through automated tools. It supports text, email, and voice calls, allowing patients to choose their preferred method of interaction. The platform is designed to securely manage health information in compliance with HIPAA standards, enabling clinicians to share updates, gather information, and coordinate care. </p>
								</section>
							</div>

							<h3>Your Own System</h3>
							<p>Caring Contacts has also been implemented via methods which require less overhead cost but may require higher costs for fidelity and adherence overtime. These strategies may be more accessible for organizations with smaller client bases or where the ratio of providers to patients is much higher. Message schedules can be built in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and the messages can be manually scheduled and delivered via email or text message. With these implementation strategies, there may be more work required to ensure that the messages are delivered and responded to in a timely manner.</p>
							<p>Medical systems have considered using eCare, MyChart, or similar options to send the Caring Contacts, which to them seems simple and appealing, but for the recipient, is neither. They will get a message that requires them to login to the system only to arrive at a message that says, “Hope you are doing well.”  We doubt that recipients will have the simple positive response that is intended after the trouble of typing the login and password (especially on their phones), and we suspect they might just stop opening eCare messages. </p>
							<p>Recommended capabilities:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Pre-program a list of 8-25 messages to be sent on a specified schedule over the year – generally one the next day, then weekly or monthly, and tapering out to every 2-4 months. </li>
								<li>If Caring Contacts are coming by text message, the system needs to have a way of assuring these messages are being received and alert the author if there are message failures.  We currently use an online messaging platform which tracked failures but authors have to regularly go and check to see what failed. </li>
								<li>Ideally, the system would have capacity to send emails or coordinate the sending of postal mail Caring Contacts.  (In a current study, participants can choose text, email, or postal mail. Texts and emails are automatically sent by the system. We program system emails to prompt our study staff to send contacts via postal mail by sending an email a few days early (to account for time in postal service) that says please write the following message in a card and send to this participant to arrive on this date.) </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Documentation</h3>
							<p>This is important to think through if you want to be consistent across your Caring Contacts team.</p>
							<p>Do you want to document Caring Contacts anywhere other than the platform you're using?</p>
							<ul>
								<li>In a healthcare environment, it may be important to document in the medical or electronic health record. If so, do you want to document every Caring Contact interaction with a patient? Or a more limited set of information such as the patient’s start and end date of the Caring Contacts intervention.</li>
								<li>It might also be important to document any distressed or high risk replies and how they were handled.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="wrapper style1 content-align-left">
						<div class="inner" id="Start">
							<h2>3. Start the Intervention</h3>
							<h3>Assign Roles</h3>
							<p>It is important to determine who will do what, so nobody falls through the cracks. Here are a few suggestions from our previous research:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Author:</b> the person from whom the Caring Contacts are sent.  In research studies this was generally a research assistant or research clinician who had no ongoing relationship with the recipient.  Authors could be current providers, but this may conflict with their ongoing care.  Other authors might be suicide prevention coordinators, Veterans or other peer support, mentors in schools, etc.</li>
								<li><b>Recipient:</b> the person who is suicidal and receiving the messages</li>
								<li><b>Sender:</b> a person who does the work to send the Caring Contacts who is not the Author (i.e., in larger systems like the VA, an administrative or other assistant may support the Author by actually sending the messages through creating a mail merge to bulk send messages, programming the messages into an online messaging platform, etc.) </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Identify and enroll recipients</h3>
							<p>Who needs it/who do you have the resources to send it to? (ask Kate how to word) Follow the enrollment steps for whatever system you’re using</p>
							<h3> Reminders for individualizing/starting the Care Plan</h3>
							<p>Review all of the dates and times of the messages on the schedule to be sure that they fall on the days and time windows your Caring Contacts team wants them to be sent. </p>
							<blockquote>Time and date should be edited for any message to individualize it for a recipient’s needs (e.g., if they work nights and you know they never wake up before noon).  </blockquote>
							<p>Remember that the messages should appear as if they are sent by your team and come across as natural as possible. Avoid having all of your messages come on the same day or time each week as this can look like spam.  </p>
							<p>Important reminders:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>You might want to make sure that if the recipient’s birthday falls during the projected Caring Contacts period, one of the existing scheduled messages is replaced by their birthday message. If their birthday falls on a weekend, your team may decide to adjust the date for the message to a day or two early and adjust the text to say, “Happy early birthday!...” </li>
								<li>If any relevant holidays or seasonal messages will occur during the recipient’s study period, those messages can also replace the nearest existing scheduled message. Again, this is to ensure that all recipients receive the same number of messages. Check to see if any of the messages written by your team will apply during the recipient’s study period and schedule them accordingly! </li>
							</ul>

							<h2>4. Running the Intervention</h2>
							<p>This is not an automated intervention. There’s a real relationship (usually) in that contact author has met the recipient. The recipient (reasonably) expects the contact author is paying attention to their replies and expects the author will be sending the messages thoughtfully and with care – and this is already strained in pre-programming the messages. So, for the intervention to be experienced as caring, outgoing messages may need to incorporate the recipient’s replies or other information. Therefore, if the author becomes aware of new information about the recipient based on replies or other information, the pre-programmed messages need to have the capacity to be changed accordingly (e.g., they replied to a message that their father died, which would make the next scheduled message a few weeks later simply saying “hope all is well with you” inadequate). After responding to the recipient’s message of loss, the author should easily be able to view the next scheduled message to see when it will be sent and what it says so they can revise it immediately, rather than remembering to take action later. </p>
							<p>Your agency is responsible for monitoring and responding to all incoming messages from your recipients (what we call “replies” to differentiate from what you send which we call “responses”). Here are some points to consider in planning your Caring Contacts program:</p>
							<h3>Monitoring</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>How often will notifications be checked? Who will be responsible for checking them?</li>
								<li>Will one person or multiple people be notified? </li> 
								<li>If a team member is sick or on vacation, who will cover for them?</li>
								<li>If/how would you like to communicate among your Caring Contacts team about who is responding to the message? </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Replies from Recipients</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>This is a two-way communication intervention, so recipients can reply at any time.</li>
								<li>Outgoing scheduled contacts are sent earlier in the day to maximize the chance that replies come during that author’s business hours.</li>
								<li>The intention is that the messages are non-demanding, so pre-programmed messages are statements of care, concern, and support that don’t require a reply.</li>
								<li>To the extent that the author does not want to encourage an extended dialogue, the author can plan a delay of 1-2 hours when responding to messages containing positive or neutral content.  (In our previous study, the mean number of messages back and forth, including the pre-programmed message that opened the exchange, was 3.5.)</li> 
								<li>Nonetheless, 67% of the time in our study, participants replied to messages.  The majority were positive or neutral or an emoji that required a comparable simple, polite response, but not immediately. </li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Responding to Recipients</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Replies to at least some of the pre-programmed Caring Contacts are expected. In our experience the vast majority of responses tend to simply show gratitude (“thanks so much”) or reciprocity (“I hope you have a good day too”) or something general like a thumbs-up emoji.  </li>
								<li>In the minority of situations, the reply will indicate distress or request assistance. This may occur when they are getting Caring Contacts and no other services from your agency, so this offers an opportunity to support someone who is in distress that might otherwise be missed. </li>
								<li>Not responding to a recipient’s reply may well be taken as either uncaring or that Caring Contacts are from a bot, spam, or otherwise disingenuous, so it is important to reply.  </li>
								<li>Responses do not have to be immediate. It is important to orient recipients at the beginning of the program about how long they can expect to wait for a response. It can also be strategic to let time pass before responding if the agency is less interested in getting into a text dialogue with the recipient. It is common in our programs to hold “by next business day” as a standard for a reply that does not indicate distress. Programs vary in how quickly a response is expected if the message indicates distress or risk. Agencies are advised to follow their existing crisis response protocols. </li>
								<li>Caring Contacts is a behavioral health intervention but not intended to function as a crisis line. Recipients should be oriented up front about when to expect a response and when not to. It is important to communicate in advance what recipients should do if they need help at a time no one can respond. We have found that recipients are flexible and respectful of this, and it has not been an issue. </li>
								<li>For the majority of replies, the author is just sending an emoji or a “You’re welcome” or a “That’s great!” or a “Hoping things keep getting better this week”… </li>
								<li>When someone sounds like things are tough but not anything emergent, the typical response is a message of validation and caring. When appropriate, a separate second message is sent, assuring the recipient is aware of formal support or crisis resources available to the recipient (if they choose). </li>
								<li>Since many responses are pretty standard, pre-programmed options that can be sent as-is or edited can reduce the time for author to prepare a response – e.g., a message that has contact information for crisis help, a message that clarifies how to re-engage with care. </li>
								<li>Most authors/agencies’ initial concern is responding to recipient replies after hours and on weekends.  Most clinics do not respond to recipient contacts at those times, instead orienting recipients on what to do when the clinic is closed.  We argue the same should be true for Caring Contacts, which is a long-term psychosocial intervention, not a crisis intervention.  In our study, the vast majority of messages came during work hours and it was cost-inefficient to have authors (or a backup clinician) on call for the 38% of the 1% of messages that were time-sensitive that came outside of business hours. </li>
								<li>A common strategy for managing after-hours replies is an “autoreply” or “out of office” message that includes who to call in a crisis.  However, the vast majority of responses are positive or neutral, e.g., a happy face or thank you to a message that said, “Hope you are doing well.” We are concerned that such a response is invalidating, is inappropriate for 99% of replies, and will communicate that we expect them to be in crisis. Individuals with lived experience of suicidality on one study’s advisory board did not like this idea at all. </li>
							</ul>
