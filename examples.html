								<h1>Examples of Successful Caring Contacts Programs</h1>
								<p>Some examples of the potential breakdown of message content from participant text replies across multiple Caring Contacts studies. Your results might look different, let us know so we can add your data for others to learn from!</p>
								<h2>Caring Contacts at St. Luke’s Health System in partnership with Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline</h2>
								<p>Caring Contacts has been successfully implemented at the St. Luke’s Health System for over 3,000 adolescent and adult patients, plus health system staff, physicians, and advanced practice providers. This program has been developed over the course of three pragmatic randomized control trials, the Mental Health Among Patients, Providers, and Staff (MHAPPS) Trial, the Suicide Prevention Among Recipients of Care (SPARC) Trial and the Comparing Suicide Prevention Interventions to Guide Follow-up Care (SPRING) Trial. St. Luke’s and the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline partner to deliver a non-research Caring Contacts program currently available for health system staff, with the goal of expanding to non-research patients in the near future.</p>
								<h2>Caring Contacts with active duty or veteran members of US Army or Marine Corps (MCP)</h2>
								<p>To test the effectiveness of augmenting standard military healthcare with Caring Contacts delivered via text message to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors over 12 months, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 military installations in the southern and western United States with Soldiers and Marines.</p>

									<h2>CARE Study</h2>
									<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of culturally-adapted Caring Contacts in reducing suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide-related hospitalizations, research was conducted in partnership with Five Native communities in Alaska, the Northern Plains, and the Southern Plains, including 4 tribal communities and 1 tribal health organization.

									<h2>Caring Contacts feedback assessment in a VA Emergency Department</h2>
									<p>There has been extensive research into the preferences of veterans for their Caring Contacts. Here we have summarized a few of the relevant studies which may provide more guidance as your organization develops your pre-scheduled messages. </p>
									<p>Survey of the preferences regarding physical Caring Contact letters by veteran patients admitted to an in-patient unit (these participants did not actually receive Caring Contacts). <b>In general, they found that some strong preferences were shown, and that demographic-specific preferences were not so strong that it would greatly impede intervention implementation.</b> There were minor differences between ages, genders, and races, but no differences between various numbers of combat deployment or military ranks. <i>(Keep in mind that only 18 of the 154 participants in this study were women, and over half were white.)</i></p>

										<p>Veterans did have a stronger preference for an inpatient or outpatient mental health counselor or primary care physician as compared to preferences for other correspondents (such as a provider from a Caring Contacts program, a fellow veteran they had not met, a crisis worker, or a non-provider from a Caring Contacts program) </p>

											<li>More older veterans said they prefer physical mail.  </li>
											<li><b>The authors note that this may be due to the age of their study sample being higher and smartphone use being lower.

										<p>A little over half said they were fine with a letter being typed, and if anything were to be handwritten, the signature and perhaps a short personal note at the bottom of the card were most important. </p>

								<p>Two-thirds approved of the example letters they were given, and a strong majority recommended their use in the VA and said they thought the letters could help someone who is in distress or feeling suicidal. </p>
								<p>A little over half said they thought the messages could make them feel connected to others. A small portion mentioned that the messages might remind them of who to contact if they were having problems.  <b>Both of these sentiments have been reiterated by other veteran and non-veteran participants in more recent studies who did actually receive the Caring Contacts intervention. </b></p>
								<p>A couple of participants mentioned concerns about the cost, confidentiality, embarrassment, and that the messages might have their impact lessened by too many being sent. <b>In recent studies, questions regarding these concerns were asked of veteran and non-veteran participants. Only a couple out of a very large sample shared that they had concerns with confidentiality, and even in a study which sent 25 messages, participants indicated that they were content with the number they had received. </b> </p>
