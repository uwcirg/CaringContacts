							<h2 id="first">What are Caring Contacts?</h2>
							<p>Caring Contacts are brief, periodic messages sent over 1-2 years that express unconditional care and concern that have reduced suicide, suicide attempts, and suicide ideation, are cost-effective, are recommended by multiple clinical practice guidelines, and have potential to scale up to a single individual intervening with hundreds of suicidal individuals. However, despite this strong support, few health systems are using Caring Contacts and many who have made maladaptive adaptations that weaken core Caring Contacts principles. These maladaptive modifications occur largely because Caring Contacts activities fall outside of established workflows or are too time consuming for clinic staff or service organizations for whom precious clinical and volunteer time should be spent with people, not paperwork. Thus, many organizations express excitement about Caring Contacts but implementation falters in the face of what can appear to be insurmountable coordination and risk management complexities.</p>

									<h2>Integration</h2>
									<p>ISACC is highly usable and pilot tested and is  a practical solution to the majority of reasons organizations don’t implement Caring Contacts or don’t implement them correctly.  We currently offer regular training and consultation on Caring Contacts and incorporate ISACC into these trainings to increase the use of Caring Contacts.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="feature">
									<i class="fas fa-users" style="color: #34A9C7;"></i>
									<h2>Collaboration</h2>
									<p>We have been collaborating with multiple clinics and community organizations on the implementation of one- and two-way Caring Contacts via text message, and also designed ISACC  to reducestaff workload for postal mail Caring Contacts, ensuring that more individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors  can be reached efficiently, and no one is left behind.</p>

									<h2>Research</h2>
									<p>A practical and efficient method of sending Caring Contacts facilitates research with veterans and active-duty service members as well as native and rural communities by our center and other research teams to improve Caring Contacts impact and efficiency. </p>

							<h2>Recipient Experience</h2>
							<img src="images/Frame 65.png" class="image fit">
							<p>Feeling suicidal is so much about feeling alone and feeling this will never change. Caring Contacts arrive periodically - weekly, monthly - over a year or more showing continued care, interest, and support with no effort from the recipient.</p>
							<p>Recipients of successful Caring Contacts programs from around the world, aftercare following hospitalization or a safety plan, and used with recipients from a variety of backgrounds - military, veteran, native communities, primary care and emergency departments, healthcare providers, etc.</p>

							<h2>Author Experience</h2>
							<img src="images/Frame 66.png" class="image fit">
							<p>Our goal is to make Caring Contacts almost as easy to send as to receive.  While we will never quite attain that - ISACC tracks all the details in a secure environment so you know the right messages are sent to the right people at the right time  and alerts you with a secure link to the key information to know what to do when someone replies.  ISACC can be used to securely reply from a phone or computer.</p>

							<h2>Why ISACC was developed</h2>
							<p>The suicide rate has increased 28% over the past two decades while heart disease, diabetes, and cancer mortalities have declined. Since 2011, new standards have led to improved suicide risk screening and risk management. Treatment, however, has lagged because delivering most well-established psychotherapies at scale is infeasible. Thus, the need for suicide prevention has skyrocketed without available resources to meet demand. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound psychological and social effects and has exacerbated the demand for telehealth and technology-mediated communications. The necessity for an accelerated shift to highly scalable and technology-based solutions for suicide prevention will not be reversed.</p>

							<h2>How ISACC was developed</h2>
							<p>Based on our research, we have adapted Caring Contacts for text message and demonstrated its feasibility and acceptability in three studies.  We have conducted a cultural adaptation of Caring Contacts for the military, native communities and a rural/frontier health system in Idaho.  We have also seen Caring Contacts is both feasible and acceptable in five native communities when sent by lay members of the community who don’t have clinical training. While a licensed clinician was available, she was unneeded after the initial training period. To facilitate scaling of Caring Contacts, we have used biomedical informatics and software development methods including human-centered design, natural language processing, agile prototyping, and electronic health record integration, to design a web-based application “Informatics Supported Authorship of Caring Contacts” or ISACC that makes Caring Contacts usable for service organizations staffed by non-clinicians as well as clinical care.</p>
