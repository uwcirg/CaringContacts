									<p>ISACC is highly usable and pilot tested and is  a practical solution to the majority of reasons organizations don’t implement Caring Contacts or don’t implement them correctly.  We currently offer regular training and consultation on Caring Contacts and incorporate ISACC into these trainings to increase the use of Caring Contacts.</p>

							<h2>Recipient Experience</h2>
							<p>Feeling suicidal is so much about feeling alone and feeling this will never change. Caring Contacts arrive periodically - weekly, monthly - over a year or more showing continued care, interest, and support with no effort from the recipient.</p>
							<p>Caring Contacts can be offered as aftercare following hospitalization or a safety plan and has been used successfully with recipients from a variety of backgrounds - military, veteran, youth, native communities, primary care and emergency departments, healthcare providers, etc. - from around the globe including the US, Australia, and Iran.</p>

							<p>Our aim is to make sending Caring Contacts almost as effortless as receiving them. Though we may never fully achieve that, ISACC securely tracks all the necessary details, ensuring that the correct messages are sent to the appropriate individuals at the right moment. It alerts you with a secure link to key information to know what to do when someone responds. ISACC allows for secure replies from both phones and computers.</p>
