						<p class="major">The Caring Contacts Intervention can be implemented via emails, texts, physical mail, and phone calls. Digital options such as email and text are familiar to the recipient, and are easy to track.</p>
						<p>While it can be more cost-efficient and timesaving to send Caring Contacts through email or texts, it has been theorized that physical mail might carry a certain emotional impact that digital communication does not. While phone calls have been previously tested, they require a greater workload for the organization. Our team has found that the majority of participants prefer to be contacted via written (text or email) communication. </p>
						<p>A primary consideration your team will need to take into account is if you are allowed to use an outside partyâ€™s program. For teams which are obligated to build their own delivery app, we have provided general guidance on the features and capabilities that are needed for a modern and effective intervention delivery service. </p>

									<h2>Mosio/new ISACC</h2>
									<p>ISACC is a pioneering informatics solution that seeks to optimize the administration of Caring Contacts to individuals in need of emotional support and ongoing connection. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we offer care to be proactive instead of reactive with the aim of cost-effectively improving mental health outcomes and overall well-being. We continue to gather valuable insights that inform decisions on how to refine ISACC, ensuring its maximum efficacy to provide compassionate and personalized care to those who need it most. </p>

									<h2>LifeWIRE</h2>
									<p>LifeWIRE is a platform that facilitates communication between clinics and patients through automated tools. It supports text, email, and voice calls, allowing patients to choose their preferred method of interaction. The platform is designed to securely manage health information in compliance with HIPAA standards, enabling clinicians to share updates, gather information, and coordinate care. </p>

									<h2>Other less expensive options</h2>
									<p>Caring Contacts has also been implemented via methods which require less overhead cost but may require higher costs for fidelity and adherence overtime. These strategies may be more accessible for organizations with smaller client bases or where the ratio of providers to patients is much higher. Message schedules can be built in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and the messages can be manually scheduled and delivered via email or text message. With these implementation strategies, there may be more work required to ensure that the messages are delivered and responded to in a timely manner. </p>
